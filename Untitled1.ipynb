        "-> In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a task and can be called on its own, not tied to any object. For example, a function like greet(name) returns a greeting message. A method, on the other hand, is a function that is part of a class and works with objects created from that class. It always takes at least one parameter, usually self, which refers to the object itself. For example, a method like greet(self) in a Person class is called using an object (like person.greet()). The main difference is that methods belong to objects, while functions do not.\n",

An iterator, on the other hand, is an object that keeps track of the current position in the iterable and provides the next value using the __next__() method. When there are no more values, the iterator raises a StopIteration exception. While an iterable can be used with a for loop, an iterator is the actual object that allows iteration by producing one item at a time upon calling next(). The key difference is that iterables are objects that can generate iterators, and iterators are objects that consume iterables to yield their elements.\n",
